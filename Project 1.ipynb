Just recently theres be an influx of delays. Another source of bias in the analysis could be the time of day delays are more likely to happen. According to \"If You Want to Avoid Delays, This Is the Best Time of the Day to Fly\", an article written by Brooke Nelson, delays are more likely to happend around 6-7 p.m. The reason that could be a bias is those type of delays usually mean the plane would depart a few minutes after scheduled time. Those types of delays shouldn't be compared to the Delays such as Weather Delays. Also Weather Delays are dependent on the weather which airport and airline companies have no control of.

Doing this reduces the bias of the data being less relevent. If the airport that had least amount delays saw an increased in delays within the past 5-7 years then the airport and customers would have misleading information. When it comes to the afternoon delays, while collecting data it would be up to the data scientist whether or not they would take those delays as imporant as other delays in the dataset. Lastly, for weather delays I wouldn't even collect that because that's nothing the airports or airlines companies can control.* "

For example, we would suggest collecting the data within reasonable time period maybe every 1-3 years. This way we have a relevent dataset to look at when asking for changes. We suggest not counting delays that took place in the middle of the day and caused less than 20 minutes shift in depart time. As those delays are not as important as others. Lasly, we would suggest not counting delays caused by weather at all because airlines and airports can't affect them.*"
