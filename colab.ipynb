        "> **Question 1:** One bias in the data we have been provided is that all the photos may not be clear enough for our model to really determine if the patients lungs were infected. Looking at some of the pictures while we were doing the exploratory data analysis section, we compared a normal x-ray from the training folder with a infected x-ray from the training folders. If we did not have the titles on we wouldn't know the difference between some the two photos. So we decided to change the code so we plot a image at random. Even then we still couldn't tell the difference. So if human eyes could not spot the difference, the model would not be able to spot the difference if the image is not clear enough. Of course nobody on the team has a medical degree or training in spotting the differences between a infected lung and a normal lung. With that said the easy solution would be to make sure that each x-ray image was clear. Also to use the model aswell with a doctor to give paitents the correct diagnosis. \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question 2:** A model err towards accuracy will predict how many times a model is correct overall. Whereas precision is more focus on the true and false postives in a model. Since this model will be used to determine whether or not a paintent has preumonia I would prefer for the model to err towards precision over accuracy. I find it less important that the model is right and more important that each paintent that has preumonia is taken account for. \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question 3:** The implications of massively over-classifying patients as having pneumonia are that people who don't actually have pneumonia will have to undergo treatment and unneccesary hospital visits as if the patient has pneumonia. Another more implication that is more extreme is the model and doctor diagnosing a paintent with pneumonia and they have a even more extreme and fatal such as Tuberculosis and lung cancer which similar to pneumonia affects the lungs.. \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question 4:** The implications of massively under-classifying patients as having pneumonia is paintent having pneumonia without knowing. This could led to the paitent not getting the neccesary treatment needed and could lead to more serious health concerns. \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question 5:** Having only one technician make the initial call is very concerning. There should be more then one opinion because leading towards the model or that one doctor could lead to the misdiagnosing discussed already. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Other considerations we have would be to consider using a multiclassifier model. The more information the computer has the better and if there was a model that could predict other lung diseases like lung cancer or tuberculosis it might end up saving lives. Imagine going to the hospital being told you don't have pneumonia, based on the model, and later on find out that you actually have lung cancer. A multiclassifer model would avoid that mistake. \n",
